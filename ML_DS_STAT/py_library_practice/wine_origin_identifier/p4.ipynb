        "> As a data scientist for a large winery in Italy I have been given the task of classifing 3 boxes of Italian wine without any indication of their origin. I have been given the task to determaine the wine's origin based on their chemical data. As accuracy is more valued than explainability, I will develope a set of complex ensemble modles to determine the reigen of the region of the wines. The main purpose of ensemble models is to achive accurate results by combining many less powerful classifers together. In this task 14 different models will be tested on the given data:\n",
